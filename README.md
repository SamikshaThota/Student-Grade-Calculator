How It Works  
1️⃣ The program prompts the user to enter:  
   - Student Name  
   - Roll Number  
   - Marks for 5 subjects (or more)  
2️⃣ It calculates:  
   - **Total Marks** = Sum of all subject marks  
   - **Percentage** = `(Total Marks / Max Marks) * 100`  
   - **Grade** based on percentage:  
     - `90-100%` → **Grade A**  
     - `80-89%` → **Grade B**  
     - `70-79%` → **Grade C**  
     - `Below 70%` → **Grade D**  
3️⃣ The final result is displayed with total marks, percentage, and grade.
