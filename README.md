# Student Grade Calculator  
A simple Java program that calculates the total marks, percentage, and grade of a student based on their subject scores.

## Features
Accepts student details (Name, Roll Number)  
Takes input for multiple subjects  
Computes total marks and percentage  
Assigns grades based on percentage  
Displays results in a structured format  

How It Works  
The program prompts the user to enter:  
   - Student Name  
   - Roll Number  
   - Marks for 5 subjects (or more)  
It calculates:  
   - **Total Marks** = Sum of all subject marks  
   - **Percentage** = `(Total Marks / Max Marks) * 100`  
   - **Grade** based on percentage:  
     - `90-100%` → **Grade A**  
     - `80-89%` → **Grade B**  
     - `70-79%` → **Grade C**  
     - `Below 70%` → **Grade D**  
The final result is displayed with total marks, percentage, and grade.  

Technologies Used:
- **Java** (Core Java concepts)  
- **Java Scanner Class** for user input  
- **Conditional Statements** (if-else)
